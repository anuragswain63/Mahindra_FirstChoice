# Mahindra_FirstChoice
Analysis of Mahindra service centers across India and prediction of servicing cost

## Project levels
1. Data exploration of the files corresponding to the invoices, vehicles , servicing plants 
2. Data cleaning , elimination of features having higher occurences of null values
3. Feature engineering - such as service time from entry and exit time from service center
4. Data insights and analysis , and plotting co-relation matrix b/w features
5. Data preprocessing such as label encoding
6. Application of machine learning models like linear regression,random forest regressor
7. Trial to find customer life time value.


## Notebooks:
#### 1.0_as_initial_data_exploration_invoice.ipynb:
